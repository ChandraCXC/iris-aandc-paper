\textbf{\textit{\label{fig:load_data}} } Building the SED of blazar PKS 1127-14 in Iris. \textit{Top-left:} Data from the NED SED Service, a local file and from a SAMP message are managed in the SED Builder. \textit{Bottom-left:} The various data Segments plotted in $\mathrm{\nu F \left( \nu \right)}$ in the SED Viewier. Squares show data with flux uncertainties, whereas the pink diamonds denote points without associated uncertainties. Each Segment in the SED Bduilder is plotted in a different color. Black squares are the data taken from NED; the pink sqaures in the radio are the data from PLANCK; and the red, yellow, blue, and green sqaures in the near-IR are the for WISE bands. \textit{Right:} An ASDC Catalog Query form for PKS 1127-14. The user searches for data between specified dates and available instruments (Swift and GALEX in this case). The data may be added the open SED \texttt{PKS1127-14}.
