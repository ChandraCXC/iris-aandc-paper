\textbf{\label{fig:fitting} Fitting Visualization} Visualization of a linear combination of log-parabolas and blackbody distributions for FRSQ blazar PKS 1127-145, fit with Neldermead optimization and least-square statistics. \textit{Left:} The best fit linear combination overlaid on the SED data as a red curve. The blue line shows the spectral range over which the data was fit. Below the main plot are residuals of the fitted curve, in dex units. \textit{Top-right:} The Fitting Tool window. The model components used in the fit and their fitted parameter values are listed in the Components field. Below that is the Model Expression, in which the components are linearly combined. Note that components are referenced by the \textit{c#} suffix of the component name. \textit{Bottom-right:} The fitting options and results. Here, the user chooses between Neldermead, Levenberg-Markwardt, and Monte-Carlo optimization and various least square and \mathrm{\Chi}^{2} statisitcs. The fit statistics are reported here after the fit has been performed.
