\textbf{\label{fig:fitting} Fitting Visualization} Visualization of a linear combination of log-parabolas and blackbody distributions for FRSQ blazar PKS 1127-145, fit with Neldermead optimization and least-square statistics. \textit{Top:} The best fit linear combination is overlaid on the SED data as a red curve. The blue line shows the spectral range over which the data was fit. \textit{Bottom:} The residuals of the fitted curve, in dex units.
