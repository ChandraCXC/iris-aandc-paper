\textbf{\label{fig:fitting_window} Fitting Visualization} Visualization of a linear combination of {\it{logparab}}s and {\it{blackbody}}s for FRSQ blazar PKS 1127-145, fit with Neldermead optimization and the least-square statistic. {\it{Top}} The best fit linear combination is overlaid on the SED data as a red curve. The blue line shows the spectral range over which the high-energy \it{logparab} is fit. \it{Bottom} The residuals of the fitted curve, in dex units. Users can toggle between dex and linear units by clicking "Plot Residulas/Ratios."
